SOFTWARE:
=========
- Collection of programs meant for performing specific operations
- Classification:
    - System Software
        - Development of device drivers
        - Development of language compilers, interpretors etc
        - Development of RTOS
        - Ex: C, 8086 etc
    - Application Software
        - To develop projects or Softwares for org.
        - Two types of technologies
            - Front End technologies
                - Platform Dependent
                - Platform Independent
            - Back End technologies
                - FS
                - RDBMS
    * Standalone Apps vs Distributed Apps
    - Internet Software


Programing languages:
====================
- Compilation + Interpretation
- Java, .Net etc

Scripting languages:
- Interpretation
- JS, Python etc


Java:
=====
- Compilation + Interpretation phase
- .java -> .class (byte) -> JVM -> JIT -> results
- What makes Java Platform Independent?


SQL VS NOSQL:
============
- File Storage system challenges
- Introduction to RDBMS
- DB:
    - a structured set of data held in a computer, especially one that is accessible in various ways.

- SQL DB
    - Traditional RDBMS
    - Rows , Columns
    - Fixed Schema
    - Oracle, MySQL, SQL Server etc
- NOSQL DB
    - Documental Storage
    - Json data
    - Flexible  Schema
    * What is a JSON?
        - JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight format that is used for data interchanging. 
        - It is based on a subset of JavaScript language (the way objects are built in JavaScript).
    - MongoDB, CouchDB, Elasticsearch etc


XML vs JSON:
============
- XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language. XML was designed to store and transport data. XML was designed to be both human- and machine-readable.
- JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate.
- JSON is Like XML Because
    - Both JSON and XML are "self describing" (human readable)
    - Both JSON and XML are hierarchical (values within values)
    - Both JSON and XML can be parsed and used by lots of programming languages  
    - Both JSON and XML can be fetched with an XMLHttpRequest
- JSON is Unlike XML Because
    - JSON doesn't use end tag
    - JSON is shorter
    - JSON is quicker to read and write
    - JSON can use arrays
- Using XML : 
    - Fetch an XML document 
    - Use the XML DOM to loop through the document
    - Extract values and store in variables
- Using JSON : 
    - Fetch a JSON string
    - JSON.Parse the JSON string

WebServices:
============
- Web service is a standardized medium to propagate communication between the client and server applications on the World Wide Web.
- Web services provide a common platform that allows multiple applications built on various programming languages to have the ability to communicate with each other.
- Types:
    - SOAP Simple Object Access Protocol.
    - REST REpresentational State Transfer.


ELK Introduction:
=================
- public cloud security tools and log analytics platforms
- ELK Stack is a complete log analysis solution which helps in deep searching, analyzing and visualizing the log generated from different machines.

What is ELK?
============
- Elasticsearch is a NoSQL database which is based on Lucene search engine and is built with RESTful APIs. It is a highly flexible and distributed search and analytics engine.
- Logstash is the data collection pipeline tool. It the first component of ELK Stack which collects data inputs and feeds it to the Elasticsearch. It collects various types of data 
from different sources, all at once and makes it available immediately for further use.
- Kibana is a data visualization tool. It is used for visualizing the Elasticsearch documents and helps the developers to have an immediate insight into it.

ELK Stack Architecture:
======================

LogFiles <- Beats -> Logstash -> Elasticsearch <- Kibana


Elasticsearch vs Database:
==========================
Elasticsearch   Database
Index           Database
Type            Table
Document        Row
Field           Column


- When you work with Elasticsearch there are three major steps which you need to follow:
    - Indexing
        - process of adding the data Elasticsearch
    - Mapping
        - process of setting the schema of the index
    - Searching
        - search query with specific index and type
