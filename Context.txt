SOFTWARE:
=========
- Collection of programs meant for performing specific operations
- Classification:
    - System Software
        - Development of device drivers
        - Development of language compilers, interpretors etc
        - Development of RTOS
        - Ex: C, 8086 etc
    - Application Software
        - To develop projects or Softwares for org.
        - Two types of technologies
            - Front End technologies
                - Platform Dependent - .Net,C
                - Platform Independent - Java
            - Back End technologies
                - FS
                - RDBMS
    * Standalone Apps vs Distributed Apps
    - Internet Software / Web applications


Programing languages:
====================
- Compilation + Interpretation
- Java, .Net etc

Scripting languages:
- Interpretation
- JS, Python etc


Java:
=====
- Compilation + Interpretation phase
- .java -> .class (byte) -> JVM -> JIT -> results
- What makes Java Platform Independent?


SQL VS NOSQL:
============
- File Storage system challenges
- Introduction to RDBMS
- DB:
    - a structured set of data held in a computer, especially one that is accessible in various ways.

- SQL DB
    - Traditional RDBMS
    - Rows , Columns
    - Fixed Schema
    - Oracle, MySQL, SQL Server etc
- NOSQL DB
    - Documental Storage
    - Json data
    - Flexible  Schema
    * What is a JSON?
        - JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight format that is used for data interchanging. 
        - It is based on a subset of JavaScript language (the way objects are built in JavaScript).
    - MongoDB, CouchDB, Elasticsearch etc


XML vs JSON:
============
- XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language. XML was designed to store and transport data. XML was designed to be both human- and machine-readable.
- JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate.
- JSON is Like XML Because
    - Both JSON and XML are "self describing" (human readable)
    - Both JSON and XML are hierarchical (values within values)
    - Both JSON and XML can be parsed and used by lots of programming languages  
    - Both JSON and XML can be fetched with an XMLHttpRequest
- JSON is Unlike XML Because
    - JSON doesn't use end tag
    - JSON is shorter
    - JSON is quicker to read and write
    - JSON can use arrays
- Using XML : 
    - Fetch an XML document 
    - Use the XML DOM to loop through the document
    - Extract values and store in variables
- Using JSON : 
    - Fetch a JSON string
    - JSON.Parse the JSON string

WebServices:
============
- Web service is a standardized medium to propagate communication between the client and server applications on the World Wide Web.
- Web services provide a common platform that allows multiple applications built on various programming languages to have the ability to communicate with each other.
- Types:
    - SOAP Simple Object Access Protocol.
    - REST REpresentational State Transfer.
